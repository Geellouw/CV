                        <p><strong>Date of birth:</strong> 1 September 1992</p>
                        <p><strong>Nationality:</strong> Namibian</p>
                        <p>
                            I am a Namibian-registered Professional Engineer with over <span id="years">6</span> years
                            of experience in civil  and structural engineering.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My background includes the design, detailing, contract administration, project management,
                            and supervision of bridges, retaining walls,
                            water infrastructure, and large-scale commercial and institutional buildings. Some of the
                            key projects I have contributed to include the NEOM Trojena Lake development and the
                            Windhoek to Hosea Kutako Freeway.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition to my core engineering expertise, I have a strong interest in software and
                            automation. I regularly work with tools such as AutoCAD, Revit, and Prokon, and have
                            developed programming skills in Python, JavaScript, and Java, which I use to streamline
                            design processes and increase efficiency.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I enjoy solving complex engineering problems with practical, creative solutions. Whether
                            working in the office or on-site, I am committed to delivering quality work that supports
                            sustainable and well-executed infrastructure.
